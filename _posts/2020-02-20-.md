I have downloaded [Wind River Linux 10.19.BASE](https://github.com/WindRiver-Labs/wrlinux-x), and generated an image for the [UDOO](/hardware#UDOO). Results are recorded in [pkok/udoo-wrlinux](https://github.com/pkok/udoo-wrlinux)


I ran the following script:
```bash
mkdir udoo-os
cd udoo-os
git clone https://github.com/WindRiver-Labs/wrlinux-x
./wrlinux-x/setup.sh --machines intel-x86-64 --recipes openssh cmake make libgcc gcc glibc boost mesa mesa-gl libusb1 libxcursor libxi libxinerama libxrandr
```

I edited the ``udoo-os/build/config/local.conf`` file.  These variables' values are changed:
- ``BB_NO_NETWORK ?= '0'``
- ``PACKAGE_CLASSES ?= "package_deb"``

I then followed the directions in ``udoo-os/README``
```bash
. environment-setup-x86_64-wrlinuxsdk-linux 
. ./oe-init-build-env
bitbake wrlinux-image-std
```
The process took 6h40m, so uuuh yeah, do something else in the meantime.

The process crashes with some Python related errors, passing too many arguments to some process (forgot to log it properly). I tried to deactivated pyenv (through removing it from ``~/.bashrc`` for the whole bitbake process, maybe it starts new bash sessions), but did not work.

Retrying the same process with adding the ``--dl-layers`` to ``./winlinux-x/setup.sh`` tomorrow.
