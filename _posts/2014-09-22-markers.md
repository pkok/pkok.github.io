**Please don't remove the markers in the lab**

Hey fellow lab user,

You probably have seen some markers hanging around like these:

<figure>
<img style="width: 15%; display: inline;" src="/assets/img/aruco/682.jpg" title="ArUco marker 682">
<img style="width: 15%; display: inline;" src="/assets/img/aruco/1023.jpg" title="ArUco marker 1023">
<img style="width: 15%; display: inline;" src="/assets/img/aruco/341.jpg" title="ArUco marker 341">
<img style="width: 15%; display: inline;" src="/assets/img/aruco/514.jpg" title="ArUco marker 514">
<img style="width: 15%; display: inline;" src="/assets/img/aruco/530.jpg" title="ArUco marker 530">

I use these for my thesis research about localization.  Please don't move them, as I have to know their position very precisely.  If you move them without me knowing, I will think there are many bugs in my code, which might not be the case.  This will make me cry, probably.

These markers are made by [ArUco](http://www.uco.es/investiga/grupos/ava/node/26), an easy toolkit to recognize fiducial markers.  I chose for ArUco as these markers are recognized quickly.  For more information, [check its website](http://www.uco.es/investiga/grupos/ava/node/26).

Thank you for not messing with these markers!
