During the latest thesis coaching session, Toto suggested using an RTOS to synchronize the external devices (and thus their clock signals).

First, I will give a short problem overview.  Then, I will document my search for a fitting RTOS.

## Problem
The thesis topic is in the field of visual-inertial SLAM.  For this topic, I could only find [one fitting dataset]({% post_url 2018-11-12- %}), and thus will need to make another dataset.

Earlier, I have written about synchronization problems between external devices with their own, independent clocks:
- [25 February 2019: Synchronization statistics of Structure Core and RealSense D435i]({% post_url 2019-02-25- %})
- [21 October 2014: Polling, or why ROS's timestamps still might work]({% post_url 2014-10-21- %})
- [16 October 2014: Why ROS's timestamps are not enough]({% post_url 2014-10-16- %})

A short recap: when external devices record timestamped data, that timestamp is either:
1. provided by the *recording* device itself, assigned before/after/during capturing the data;
2. provided by the *receiving* device, assigned when the data is requested/received.

Both of these approaches have their pros and cons, but *spoiler*: multi-sensor setups mess things up royally.

### Sensor-provided timestamp
Pro:
- Exact time w.r.t. recording moment

Con:
- It's a different clock from the collecting device's clock.  They have slightly different offsets, will run out of sync, ...  This is not a problem until you need to know the capturing order of data from two different sensors.
- The device's clock might count in seconds, ticks, nanoseconds, ... Not easy to translate to "wall clock time".
- The timestamps are not comparable with timestamps of another device's clock.  You know nothing about the time-relation between captured data of different sensors.

### Host-timestamp
This will be mostly about timestamping at arrival of a package at the host,  This is the model ROS uses for all the timestamped messages.

Pro:
- Only one clock, which can be translated to "wall clock time". Seems easy to understand.

Con:
- Packages don't arrive at regular intervals to your software under non-RT OS's.  That means that, given equal time $$d$$ between all captured data, on the host system you won't see anything of that.  The average is not even guaranteed near $$d$$. 
- Correlated to the above, receiving data from sensor 1 with frequency $$n$$ Hz and data from sensor 2 with frequency $$k \cdot n$$ Hz, you are not guaranteed to have $$k$$ packages of sensor 2 between two packages of sensor 1.
- Depending on the transfer protocol, the order of arrival at the host is not guaranteed.  That means that, given data $$D_1$$ captured at (real-world time) $$t_1$$ and data $$D_2$$ captured at $$t_2 > t1$$, the timestamp of $$D_1$$ might even be after $$D_2$$.


## RTOS
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_operating_system), "A **real-time operating system (RTOS)** is an [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) (OS) intended to serve [real-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing) applications that process data as it comes in, typically without buffer delays."  Sounds like what might solve the above issues!

Requirements for the RTOS are given by the connected devices:
- Needs to run on an x86 (either 32 or 64 bit) architecture
- USB 3.0 support
- Ethernet support
- UNIX/Linux-compatibility (preferably even supporting a ``.deb``)

Also, proper documentation would be nice, for my first try with an RTOS ;)

A good starting point might be Wikipedia's [comparison of real-time operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_real-time_operating_systems).  Some interesting highlights, in a pretty meaningless order (I'm CTRL+F'ing for ``Linux`` and ``x86`` my way through the list):

So the top interesting ones for now are 
- Full Linux:
    - Community-driven: RIOT, Xenomai
    - Commercial but free: Wind River Linux
    - Paid (maybe educational license?): LxWin, RedHawk Linux
- RTOS-kernel patch for Linux, free: ChronOS, RTAI

## What now
1. Contact RedHawk Linux 
2. Try out Wind River Linux
3. See if RIOT will cooperate, maybe need [this blog post](https://blog.martine-lenders.eu/riot-board-en.html)?

## Tried options:
### Wind Linux
I have downloaded Wind River Linux 10.19.BASE from [https://github.com/WindRiver-Labs/wrlinux-x](), and generated an image:
```bash
mkdir udoo-os
cd udoo-os
git clone https://github.com/WindRiver-Labs/wrlinux-x
./wrlinux-x/setup.sh --machines intel-x86-64 --recipes openssh cmake make libgcc gcc glibc boost mesa mesa-gl libusb1 libxcursor libxi libxinerama libxrandr
```
