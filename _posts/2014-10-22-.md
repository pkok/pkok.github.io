The polling on the Prosilica does not work yet.  Images of irregular data size are sent, even in "regular"/streaming mode.

I connect the camera and find its IP with `nmap` (see [yesterday's post]({% post_url 2014-10-21- %})).  I start up the ROS node with a [launch file](https://github.com/pkok/ros_sandbox/blob/c0ad37a7dc6dbdcd2c4fbdc75681a4814934896c/launch/prosilica.launch) (`trigger_mode` set on `FixedRate` @30 Hz, in `Mono8`).  Certain errors and warnings show up:

```
[ERROR] [1413992271.480062233]: [AVT_Vimba_ROS]: Could not get feature Gain
 Error: Not found.
[ERROR] [1413992271.503721682]: [AVT_Vimba_ROS]: Could not get feature DecimationHorizontal
 Error: Not found.
[ERROR] [1413992271.504306063]: [AVT_Vimba_ROS]: Could not get feature DecimationVertical
[ WARN] [1413992271.535111761]: Camera calibration file /opt/ros/indigo/share/avt_vimba_camera/calibration.yaml not found.
```

I don't think the top three are alarming.  Bottom one is valid.

When collecting images in RQT, sometimes the Image View "blinks".  In the console, the following message appears in greenish ("terminal color 7"):

```
ImageView.callback_image() while trying to convert image from 'mono8' to 'rgb8' an exception was thrown (Image is wrongly formed: step < width * byte_depth * num_channels  or  477 != 640 * 1 * 1)
```

`477` is varying.  When running ROS's `camera_calibration` tool, results in the following output:

```bash
$ rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py -s 8x6 -p chessboard -q 0.027 image:=/camera/image_raw camera:=/camera
('Waiting for service', '/camera/set_camera_info', '...')

Killed
```
The process was `Killed` because the window turned gray for some time and I used `Ctrl+C` to quit.

It seems that, for some reason, image dimensions are not constant.

Setting the camera in [polling mode](https://github.com/pkok/ros_sandbox/blob/ba3ba86c0cfbbb772181aabcea63588ae4ce6478/launch/prosilica.launch) (set `trigger_mode` at `Software`) lets service `/camera/request_image` appear.  It is a [`polled_camera/GetPolledImage`](http://docs.ros.org/api/polled_camera/html/srv/GetPolledImage.html) service.  Sending a request should let an image appear in a topic `response_namespace + "/image_raw"`.  I have tried setting each of these values in the service call:

- `response_namespace` to `/camera`
- `timeout.nsecs` to 50000
- `roi.height` to 480, `roi.width` to 640

The response always has `success = False`, `stamp = 0` and `status_message` always switches between `Captured frame but failed to process it` and `AVT_Vimba_ROS error`.  However, `response_namespace + "/image_raw"` does appear as a topic.  When the second messge appears, the error messages indicate that the camera was offline.
