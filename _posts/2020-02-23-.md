Earlier I tried to work with Wind River Linux on the [UDOO](/hardware#udoo).  Not sure if it's going to work, but RTAI seems like a reliable option.

Earlier this week I made a list of my options for an RTOS:


> 1. Contact RedHawk Linux
> 2. Try out Wind River Linux
> 3. See if RIOT will cooperate, maybe need this [blog post](https://blog.martine-lenders.eu/riot-board-en.html)?

Just a quick update on those points:
1. I got a reply from Red Hawk.  I can call them for more information.
2. I've [managed to compile]({% post_url 2020-02-21- %}) wrlinux.  Not a clue on how to get it on the board itself, though.  Wind River's [overview of Board Support Packages](https://marketplace.windriver.com/index.php?bsp&on=list&type=platform&value=Wind%20River%20Linux%20LTS%2018) lists the [Intex x86](https://marketplace.windriver.com/index.php?bsp&on=details&bsp=13334) series.  However, this BSP does not seem to support anything from the [Celeron/Braswell](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/91831/intel-celeron-processor-n3160-2m-cache-up-to-2-24-ghz.html) series (which the [UDOO](/hardware#udoo) uses).
3. RIOT also does not list this board as a [supported platform](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/RIOT-Platforms).

So, #2 and #3 are dead ends for now. Someone at uni suggested to give RTAI a try.  RTAI will patch an existing Linux kernel with real-time modules.  Good starts on RTAI seem to be:
- [RTAI: a Beginner's Guide](https://www.rtai.org/?Documentation___Articles___RTAI%3A_a_Beginner%27s_Guide&id=40).
- Downloading the latest version (right now: [RTAI 5.2](https://www.rtai.org/userfiles/downloads/RTAI/rtai-5.2.tar.bz2)).
