New mission: replace the camera's orientation with information of the IMU.  More detailed problem description:


## Problem description ##
Given is a vision-inertial tracking system with the following four frames of reference:

- IMU: $$\cal{I}$$
- Camera: $$\cal{C}$$
- Marker: $$\cal{M}$$
- World: $$\cal{W}$$

Each frame $$\cal{F}$$ has a pose (rotation/orientation and translation/position) $$T_{\cal{G} \cal{F}} = R_{\cal{G} \cal{F}} \circ \vec{t}_{\cal{G} \cal{F}}$$ with respect to the other frames $$\cal{G}$$.  $$T_\cal{F} = R_\cal{F} \circ \vec{t}_\cal{F}$$ denote the frame's absolute pose (or, shorthand for $$T_{\cal{W} \cal{F}} = R_{\cal{W} \cal{F}} \circ \vec{t}_{\cal{W} \cal{F}}$$).

$$T$$, $$R$$ and $$\vec{t}$$ can be represented as 4Ã—4 matrices, but I will try to keep the discussion representation independent.

See below image for their relationships:

 R_i
+-----+ T_c_i  +--------+
| IMU |<-------| camera |
+-----+        +--------+
                   |
                   | T_c_m
                   |
                   v
               +--------+                 +-------+
               | marker |                 | world |
               +--------+                 +-------+
```

$$T_{\cal{C} \cal{I}}$$ is fixed, because frames $$c$$ and $$i$$ are attached to the same rigid body.

$$R_\cal{I}$$ is observed by the IMU.

$$T_{\cal{C} \cal{M}}$$ is observed by the camera.

Assume that the perception of $$T_{\cal{C} \cal{M}}$$ is noisy, especially $$R_{\cal{C} \cal{M}}$$.  This implies that $$R_\cal{C}$$ is noisy as well.

Find a method to update $$R_\cal{C}$$ from the IMU's data $$R_\cal{I}$$.  Try to keep $$\vec{t}_\cal{C}$$ constant.
