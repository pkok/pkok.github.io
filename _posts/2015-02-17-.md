Now that the camera is triggered by the IMU and I implemented the first model of [Bleser et al.](#bleser2008advanced), I really need to obtain the extrinsic multi-sensor calibration.  Otherwise I can't test that first model.

I have tried Kalibr again (see [Furgale et al.](#furgale2013unified)).  This gave me a different issue than before.  After "initializing a pose spline", it prints a ROS fatal message: `[FATAL] Failed to obtain orientation prior!`.  I had contact with the authors about this.  They noted that the camera often lost track of the calibration target, and when it did find the target, reprojection of the corners was messy.  They suggested to 1. keep the calibration targets in the camera's field of view, 2. optimize lighting conditions, and 3. get better intrinsic camera calibration parameters.  Solutions to each:

1. Done.
2. I aimed two construction lights on the calibration target, and turned the construction lights around the football field of our RoboCup lab on.  This second set of lights gives a more diffuse light source.
3. I used the camera calibration tool that comes with Kalibr.  I decided to use the `pinhole` camera model and `radtan` noise model.

Other extrinsic multi-sensor calibration methods that seem interesting, to be investigated in this order, and in parallel with the email contact with the Kalibr team:
1. [Lobo and Dias](#lobo2007relative)'s work.  Although it requires a turntable and specific placement of the sensors, and is described as "labor intensive" by [Hol](#hol2011sensor), I do recall that they had a publicly available implementation.  Haven't found it yet.
2. [Kelly and Sukhatme](#kelly2011visualinertial) and [Mirzaei and Roumeliotis](mirzaei2008kfbased) use Kalman Filter based calibration methods.
3. [Hol](#2011sensor) uses a "grey-box" method.

But if I can't reduce the motion blur to something acceptable for a calibration method, I might need to switch to a simulated environment for my experiments.  Toby was okay with this, but I will have to discuss this as well with Arnoud.
