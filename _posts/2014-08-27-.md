I can work around the issues that `kalibr_calibrate_cameras` raise.  Also, I should learn more about ROS.

Until now, I cannot run `kalibr_calibrate_cameras`, because "No corners could be extracted for camera /cam0/image_raw".  I thought that the four parameters needed by Kalibr to calibrate a camera -- *fu*, *fv*, *pu* and *pv* -- were not the same as the ones given by OpenCV, but I was wrong.  Those parameters are described in the 3Ã—3 `camera_matrx`, vectorized as `[fu, 0, pu, 0, fv, pv, 0, 0, 1]`.

I want to create a ROS bag with camera data and IMU data.  Previously, to make the dataset for `kalibr_calibrate_cameras`, I used my own [image_grabber.cpp](https://github.com/pkok/grabber/blob/59efd2caeef39dcf5ea40e58d81733817bfc5b3c/image_grabber.cpp) and assumed similar update frequencies of the two cameras.  For the combined bag, I should use some tools that can do that already.  ROS should have those tools.  I went through their [tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials#Beginner_Level), and now will look into the [image_pipeline](http://wiki.ros.org/image_pipeline) and [xsens_driver](http://wiki.ros.org/xsens_driver).
