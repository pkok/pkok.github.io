The module errors of Kalibr are gone, but Kalibr can't recognize the chessboard on RGB video.  Maybe images should be grayscale?

The issues with Kalibr as described in the [previous post](http://pkok.github.io/2014/09/03/) were due to forgetting to source the `devel/setup.bash` file of Kalibr.  My bash `ros` function now not only sources the required ROS `.sh` file and adds each module in `~/ros/repos/` to `$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`, it also sources their setup files.

---

Now the program runs, but I get an `IndexError` with a red-highlighted **`[FATAL] [1410190209.710162]: No corners could be extracted for camera /logitech_camera/image_raw! Check the calibration target configuration and dataset.`** error.

```

This apparently happens because the chessboard is not found, but why?  I should check out the [user forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kalibr-users).

I just saw that the (utility might not work with RGB images, they should be in grayscale](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kalibr-users/dRoLkps0jWw/EgYxJ5_HnUsJ).  I am looking up how to convert a `sensor_msgs/Image` topic to grayscale.
