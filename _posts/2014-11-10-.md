Connection schemas for my Arduino.

## IMU

Arduino | Transistor[^0] | IMU     |
:-------|:---------------|:--------|
5 V     | 1              | VIN     |
GND     | 3              | GND     |
A3      | 2              |         |
A4      |                | SDA     |
A5      |                | SCL[^1] |

[^0]: Pins counted as with the flat side towards me.
[^1]: Cable got detached and this is my best bet. I should test this.

## Camera, Sync mock setup

Use the Button example sketch and connect as in that sketch.  Instead of the LED, use the signal cable.  When you don't have a button with you, use a separate wire and a condensator to avoid bouncing.  Switch between +5V and GND to change the signal.
