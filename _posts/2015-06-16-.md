`listener` makes log recordings of `gazebo::msgs::IMU`, `gazebo::msgs::ImageStamped` and `gazebo::msgs::PosesStamped`. However, my `reader` has problems reading it. Error message at message round 2:

```
*** Error in `./bin/reader_poses2pose': double free or corruption (out): 0x00007ffe6f77abf0 ***
Aborted (core dumped)
```
