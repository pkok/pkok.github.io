I started working with [Kalibr](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr) today. Main conclusion: compilation takes quite some time.

To get started, I installed ROS following the [website's instructions](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu).  That was quite fast (&leq; 10 min).  After that, I followed the [instructions of Kalibr](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/wiki/Installation), which took more than a lunch break (actually, somewhere near 3 hours) and some CMake magic (package `Eigen` was required, while Ubuntu only knows `Eigen3` by default).

Next, I tried to create the right [YAML configuration files](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/wiki/Yaml-formats) for the calibration targets (checkerboard, ...; copy-paste work), IMU and camera.  I got stuck at the IMU part. The order of magnitude of the values given in the example (gyro BRW: 1e-6) do not correspond with the one I found in the XSens manual (gyro bias stability: 1). I asked XSens for help.
