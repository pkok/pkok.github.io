Delft's Xsens is giving some errors, while UvA's is working fine, after configuring.  I started expecting the error when comparing both orientation filters.

Delft's Xsens is a MTi-28A53G35, UvA's Xsens is a MTi-G-700-2A5G4.  UvA's sensor is more recent.

The [Delft](http://youtu.be/THwUzMYPmOg) sensor's orientation slowly goes back to its original direction when in certain orientations, while the [UvA](http://youtu.be/ZU-MNThu69k) sensor does not.  This difference is so big that it hardly cannot be due to version differences; Xsens was reknown even before the UvA's sensor came out.

Both Xsens sensors have been configured the same:

```
rosrun xsens_driver mtdevice.py -c -p 576 -m co -s nqAGM
```

The Delft sensor does not give any error:

```
Configuring mode and settings  Ok
```

However, the UvA sensor does give an error:

```
Configuring mode and settingsMT error 0x04: Invalid message. MT error: timeout waiting for message.
```

Reading out it settings for Delft with `rosrun xsens_driver mtdevice.py -i`

```

```

And for UvA:

After playing with the order of printing statements in the code, it seems that the Delft sensor has issues with reporting on its Xsens Kalman Filter (XKF) properties (which one is set, which are available).  The XKF outputs the orientation of the sensor.  Depending of the application of the sensor a different XKF can be selected.

This might be attributed with an (unknown) bug in `xsens_driver`.  Therefore I tried to inspect both sensors in the MT Manager.  Under Linux (32-bit) none of the devices is found.  The UvA sensor is found under Windows 7.  Windows could not find proper driver for the Delft sensor, and the ones I selected from the list were not succesful (selected MTi-10, -100, -20, 200, but all were not recognized by MT Manager).

Could there be something wrong with the Delft sensor?
