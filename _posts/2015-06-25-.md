Recently installed ROS Jade (only version in Ubuntu 15.04), which requires OGRE 1.9. Gazebo requires OGRE 1.8. `gazebo` doesn't show a GUI anymore, `gz` nags about `libogre....1.8.0.so`

### Approach:
1. Purge all `libogre-1.*`
2. Install `libogre-1.8.0` and `libogre-1.8-dev`
3. Change Gazebo's cmake so that the OGRE SO's are statically linked.
4. Rebuild Gazebo
5. `make install` Gazebo
6. Purge all `libogre-1.8*`
7. Install `libogre-1.9.0` and `libogre-1.9-dev`
8. Report back here?


### How am I going to link statically to OGRE?
1. Find all `CMakeLists.txt` containing OGRE:
    ```grep -il ogre `find . -iname cmakelists.txt` ```
