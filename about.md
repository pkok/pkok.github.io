I am Patrick de Kok, a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the [Universiteit van Amsterdam](http://uva.nl/).  Currently I am working on my thesis.  I am investigating a subject in the fields of localization, sensor fusion and machine learning: can we learn the standard deviation for Kalman filters when used for an augmented reality head tracker?

This is my notebook.  Currently it functions as a lab book for my master's thesis, but when new projects arise, those will be added too.
