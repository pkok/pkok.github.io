Patrick de Kok is a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the [Universiteit van Amsterdam](http://uva.nl/) and is working on his [thesis](/thesis.html).
This is my general notebook.  It will mainly function as a lab book for my master's thesis, but there might be some other notes.  Those will most probably include my experiences with the [Dutch Nao Team](http://dutchnaoteam.nl), a RoboCup soccer team.
