I am Patrick de Kok, a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the [Universiteit van Amsterdam](https://uva.nl/).  I work at the [Hogeschool van Amsterdam](https://hva.nl) as lecturer in robotics.  Currently I am working on my thesis.  I am investigating a subject in the fields of localization, sensor fusion and machine learning: can we improve the map's quality when adding inertial information to ORBSLAM 2?

This is my notebook.  Currently it functions as a lab book for my master's thesis, but when new projects arise, those will be added too.
